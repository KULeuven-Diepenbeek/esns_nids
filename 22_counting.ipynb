    "\n",
    "A hardware friendly alternative is to use **sketches**, which additionally have some built-in collision resistance mechanisms. Instead of one-to-one mapping, one single flow is mapped to multiple counters and each counter is shared by multiple flows in the case of collisions. Sketches require less memory as the flowIDs don't have to be stored. As for the downside of using sketches, there is a possibility of overestimation."
