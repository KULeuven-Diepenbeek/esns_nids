    "## ML for simple input features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "One of the typical challenges in ML is feature selection: Which features will be used characterize the input samples and train the models? The features should be representative, contain sufficient information for the model to be able to make an informed decision, but should also avoid redundancy or useless information. Therefore, traditional features for NIDS include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The IPv4 source and destination addresses;\n",
    "- The TCP source and destination ports;\n",
    "- Statistics on the number of packets/bytes in a network flow (count, average, STD, duration, ...);\n",
    "- Network flags (e.g. TCP flags);\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, these features are provided alongside the raw network traffic data in a dataset. Most ML and DL models therefor use those features for training models, obtaining excellent results. This approach however has some considerable drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Different datasets provide different features, complicating inter-dataset comparison;\n",
    "- Extracting these features requires significant preprocessing of raw traffic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the first point is more of a general concern, the second is especially relevant when dealing with hardware: When dealing with high-speed real-time network traffic, there are only limited resources available for dealing with feature extraction. This calls for either optimized routines to extract a limited number of specific features, or for an alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative: Raw traffic-based features\n",
    "One alternative is to use the raw input traffic itself as features, instead of deriving the features from the traffic: We call such features *raw traffic-based features* (RTF). This is what we will do in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "While using RTF in some sense limits the amount of possible features, there are still three choices to be made:\n",
    "- What packet bytes to use;\n",
    "- How many packet bytes to use;\n",
    "- How many packets to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will use the first 64 bytes of each individual packet as input features. That includes the header, as well as potentially a small part of the payload. Using 64B input features therefore should provide all header information about the network flow: Source and destination information, protocol information (including flags), packet size, ... We leave the DL model to parse and use this information to its own liking. Moreover, choosing specifically 64B for input features provides several other advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 64 bytes is relatively small, limiting the required hardware resources;\n",
    "- 64 bytes is a very convenient number of bytes to work with on a hardware level.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Raw traffic-based features on hardware\n",
    "One major advantage of RTF over traditional NIDS features is that they are very easy to extract in real-time on hardware. Instead of having to design intricate counting and parsing architectures, all you need to start collecting RTF is a buffer. Simply storing the required amount of packet bytes in the buffer effectively provides the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Raw traffic-based features in software\n",
    "Simulating this behaviour in software requires a chronological iteration over the dataset, while extracting the first 64 bytes from each packet, and storing them in a buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will extract input samples from the CICIDS2017 dataset: While the dataset contains several protocols, such as ARP and ICMP, we are only interested in **TCP and UDP** packets. The trained model we will be using later on is only trained for those transport layer protocols."
